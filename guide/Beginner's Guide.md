# Beginner's Guide

### Provided Items
#### Oak Saplings & Watering Can
Pretty self explanatory. The **Oak Saplings** are there to grow trees and the **Watering Can** can be used to accelerate plant growth. This will provide wood which is the first resource you will need.
#### Sink
Infinite water source with buckets. Use this to skip having to wait for rain to get water. Use a bucket on it and it will fill it with water.
#### Thaumonomicon & Tome of Knowledge Sharing
The **Thaumonomicon** is your go-to guide for all things Thaumcraft. Here you will be researching new items, blocks and mechanics to help you on your journey. More information on basic Thaumcraft mechanics and how to use the **Thaumonomicon** can be found in the [Thaumcraft Basics](https://github.com/MyM-ModpackTeam/ThaumicSkies/blob/master/guide/Thaumcraft%20Basics.md) guide. The **Tome of Knowledge Sharing** can be used to share research with your friends. Right click to link it with your research and then have another player right click with it to copy your research. Since this pack revolves around Thaumcraft knowledge it is useful to have all members of your party up to speed without having everyone do their own research.
#### Thaumometer 
The **Thaumometer** is the first tool a Thaumaturge needs to begin understanding the world around them. Using this you can scan items and blocks to discover what aspects it is made of. More information can be found in the [Thaumcraft Basics](https://github.com/MyM-ModpackTeam/ThaumicSkies/blob/master/guide/Thaumcraft%20Basics.md) guide.
#### Goggles of Revealing
The **Goggles of Revealing** are glasses made with Thaumometers. While wearing these you will be able to see the aspects contained by certain blocks. This includes the crucible, arcane alembic, warded jars, aura nodes and infusion matrix. For more information see the [Thaumcraft Basics](https://github.com/MyM-ModpackTeam/ThaumicSkies/blob/master/guide/Thaumcraft%20Basics.md) guide.
#### Rosa Arcana & Mixed Crystal Block
The **Rosa Arcana** is a researcher's best friend. This plant, when planted on a **Crystal Block**, will produce a fragment that can be consumed to gain research aspects. The fragment produced when planted on a **Mixed Crystal Block** will give 2 of each primal aspect when used. For additional information on aspects and research see the [Thaumcraft Basics](https://github.com/MyM-ModpackTeam/ThaumicSkies/blob/master/guide/Thaumcraft%20Basics.md) guide.
