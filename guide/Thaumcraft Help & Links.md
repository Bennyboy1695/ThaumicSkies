# Thaumcraft Basics
### Thaumonomicon
The **Thaumonomicon** is a thaumaturge's best friend. It is the in-game guide that will help you with all your magical needs. With it you can research new game mechanics, blocks and items. It is made by using any type of wand on a vanilla bookshelf.

### Aspects of Magic
**Aspects** are the atoms of the minecraft world. They make up nearly everything around you and can be manipulated in various ways to aid you in your journey. You start the game only knowing the 6 Primal aspects: Aer(Air), Aqua(Water), Ignis(Fire), Terra(Earth), Ordo(Order) and Perditio(Chaos). These aspects can be combined to make **Compound Aspects**, for example Lux(Light) which is made up of Ignis and Aer. Using a **Thaumometer** you can scan blocks, items and entities to discover their aspects, given you know the aspects they contain. This means that if you only know the primals, you can't scan iron ingots because they contain Metallum(Metal). In order to scan iron ingots you would need to either already have discovered Metallum or the aspects that make it up, which are Vitreus(Crystal) and Terra. Vitreus in turn is made from Terra and Ordo so it can be discovered right away. Check the flow chart below to see all the aspect compositions.

### Research
Research is a game mechanic that allows for progression in Thaumcraft. In order to begin researching, you will need 2 Thaumcraft **Tables** and some **Scribing Tools**.
